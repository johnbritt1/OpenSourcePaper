# Open Source Paper

### The Number of Open Source Software
With the growing knowledge of technology as a whole, the knowledge of how to program is becoming more and more common. Open source gives programmers a library of code and programs to pull form and use as they can look at a program and see what makes it work. A study found "that 96 percent of all scanned applications contain some open source components and that the use of open source code increased from 36 percent to 57 percent over a one-year period" ([Source](https://www.veracode.com/sites/default/files/pdf/resources/ipapers/everything-you-need-to-know-open-source-risk/index.html)). The increase in open source programs can make  personal or commercials projects easier and cheaper to produce. We use open source daily as more and more software coming out is open source.

### The Security 
A shock to me is by making programs and code open source, it can actually make it more secure. Obviously this can go either way but with the more people using and lookng through software, the higher chance of them finding exploits or any problems that can leave the program vulnerable to attacks. But in the process of using these open source programs the users can come across these bugs and fix them. The open source code itself is constantly getting updated by things like this. The people that use them are making sure that their programs cannot be exploited and attacked.

### Linux
Linux is one of the most popular operating systems. So much that Linux is the operating system of choise for the International Space Station. The reasons for this is the open source nature of the operating system. This allows them to customize everything to their specific needs with its open source nature. Adding to this, Linux is the operating system of choice for the scientfic community as it allows total customization for each specfic experiment or need. ([Source](https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/155392-international-space-station-switches-from-windows-to-linux-for-improved-reliability)). To add to this, the International Space Station needs the security that Linux brings with it. Linus also puts less strain on the computers which can help out of date computers keep up, "Disk space and memory footprint can also be lower too. Some distributions are suitable for CPUs dating back to the Pentium family, others have a requirement of as little as 128MB of RAM and around the same amount for disk space"([Source](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/why-use-linux-11-reasons-linux-is-awesome/)). Sending stuff to the international space station can get very pricey, so keeping older computer up there can be more efficient. Which Linux would excel on.
